# Turtle Up Edutainment Game

## Overview
The **Turtle Up Edutainment Game** is an interactive educational game designed to raise awareness about sea turtle conservation, migration, and the impacts of pollution. This game is targeted at a wide audience, including children, adults, and local professionals, with the goal of fostering greater awareness and inspiring action to protect sea turtles and their habitats.

### Game Concept
Players experience the impact of human actions on sea turtles and the environment through two perspectives:
- **Human Perspective (Level 1):** Clean up beaches, sort trash, and understand the consequences of pollution.
- **Turtle Perspective (Level 2):** Navigate the ocean, scavenging for food while avoiding plastic waste and environmental hazards.

By combining engaging **gameplay** with **educational elements**, the game encourages players to reflect on real-world conservation efforts.

## Project Goals
- **Raise awareness** about the **life cycle** and **migration patterns** of sea turtles.
- **Educate players** about the **real-world threats** sea turtles face, such as **pollution** and **habitat destruction**.
- **Highlight the ecological importance** of sea turtles in **marine and beach ecosystems**.
- **Provide an engaging educational experience** that inspires action to protect sea turtles and their habitats.

## Features
- **Dual-perspective gameplay** (Human & Turtle).
- **Interactive trash collection & sorting** mechanics.
- **Educational visuals & pop-ups** on conservation topics.
- **Customizable player experience** with character selection (work in progress).
